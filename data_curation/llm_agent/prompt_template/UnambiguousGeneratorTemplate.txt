Analyze the Question: Read the question thoroughly to identify ambiguous parts. Consider the different ways the question could be interpreted based on its current wording.
Clarify the Query: Reformulate the question to eliminate ambiguity. This may involve specifying details, narrowing down broad terms, or providing additional context to guide the interpretation.

Here's an example of how to complete the task:

### Original Question:
